This project provides documentation of the development of two 
Convolutional Neural Networks a simple and an advanced model. Both 
models have the purpose of classifying 5 categories of flowers (Buttercup, 
Daffodil, Sunflower, Cowslip, Windflower) with the highest training and 
validation accuracy possible as well as the lowest training and validation 
loss possible.
